# ComfyUI Web Automation

ComfyUI-WebAutomation adds diff-aware editing, batch reruns, and remote prompts to ComfyUI. Install once with `make install`, then use `make dev` for day-to-day development; both commands copy the extension into `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/` and expose helper APIs.

## Quick Actions Toolbar

- **C ‚Äî Copy** caches every widget value and execution mode from the current graph so you can track later edits.
- **P ‚Äî Paste** restores the cached values onto matching nodes and applies any stored field remaps to mirror settings across nodes.
- **D ‚Äî Diff** compares live values against the cache, opens the diff popup, and lets you review/merge previous diffs or adjust remaps.
- **A ‚Äî Apply** writes the staged diff back into the graph and refreshes the canvas.
- **üñºÔ∏è ‚Äî Drop Picture** launches the drop modal. Drop an image to spawn a `LoadImage` node, upload the file, reapply the active diff (when present), and automatically queue three workflow runs.

## Automations & Browser
Click the **‚è© Automations** button to open the evaluation browser. Folders under `data/evals/` (and other `data/*` categories) appear as collections you can preview, multi-select, or randomize. Choosing **Run Evaluation** hands control to the automation runner, which loads each image‚Äôs workflow via `/rebase/data/view`, reapplies your diff, triggers widget callbacks such as `beforeQueued`, and queues the requested number of generations while streaming status to a corner overlay. Because the automation runs in the browser, it can be stopped with a page refresh.

For unattended batches, run `batch_processor.py <directory>` against folders that pair `image.png` with `image.txt` prompts. The script pushes prompt and resolution updates for each pair, then requests the desired number of generations through the broadcast route below.

## Diff Manager
Diffs are saved to local storage automatically and will be reloaded when the browser is opened again. To persist diffs for later use, you can save them in the diff manager. If you accidentally press the diff button, the "Undo" button will reload the last saved diff. If you have an existing diff and would like to change the values, make the changes, open the manager and press "Merge" to join two diffs together. The JSON format can be viewed in the bottom window.

Remapping from workflow to workflow is supported with Field Remapping manager. Just select the source node ID and source field, then target node and target field in the new workflow. These can be saved and reloaded

## Change Event Broadcast API
The back-end will broadcast requests via Websocket to the front-end listener. This can be used to apply diffs from an external automation source.

```
POST /rebase/forward
{
  "event": "promptReplace",
  "data": {
    "positive_prompt": "Astronaut riding a koi",
    "resolution": { "width": 1024, "height": 1024 }
  }
}
```

Current handlers implement two events:
- `promptReplace` updates the CLIP positive prompt and maps the supplied resolution to the nearest aspect-ratio widget.
- `generateImages` queues 1‚Äì8 renders through `app.queuePrompt`.

Other `event` strings are forwarded untouched, so you can wire additional listeners with `app.api.addEventListener` inside your own extensions.

An example script can be found in `scripts/batch_processor.py`

## Data & Builds
Diff exports land in `data/diffs/`, remap presets in `data/remaps/`, and evaluation assets under `data/evals/`. Regenerate frontend assets with `make build` (or `npm run build` inside `web/`) whenever you change TypeScript, then reload your ComfyUI tab or rerun `make dev` to pick up the compiled bundle.

## Testing
- Run `make test` to execute the Python API checks (pytest) and the frontend unit tests (Vitest).
- Install Python dev dependencies with `pip install pytest multidict` if they are not already available in your environment.
- The frontend tests rely on the existing `npm install` step under `web/`; re-run it after adding new dependencies.
